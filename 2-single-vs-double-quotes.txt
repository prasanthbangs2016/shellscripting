Q-Difference between single and double quotes in Bash


If you're referring to what happens when you echo something, 
the single quotes will literally echo what you have between them,
while the double quotes will evaluate variables between them and output the value of the variable.

For example, this

#!/bin/sh
MYVAR=sometext

echo "double quotes gives you $MYVAR"
echo 'single quotes gives you $MYVAR'
will give this:

double quotes gives you sometext
single quotes gives you $MYVAR

Example:

$ echo "$(echo "upg")"
upg
$ echo '$(echo "upg")'
$(echo "upg")
